        <h1>What is a risk-limiting audit?</h1>
        <p>
        A risk limiting audit is a procedure that can be used to limit the chance of outside interference with an election.
        This is done by preforming hand recounts of a small fraction of ballots after the election is over and using statistical
        analysis to guarantee with certainty that the chance of manipulation of election results is less than or equal to the
        risk-limit set by the auditor.
        </p>

        <h1>Why are election audits important?</h1>
        <p>
        Auditing is an easy way to protect the security and integrity of elections. It doesn't require
        performing a full hand recount, or even very many ballots counted at all. Elections can still use
        computerized counting and reporting processes: auditing ensures that the reported results match
        the actual paper ballots cast with at least 1 - (risk limit) certainty.
        </p>

        <h1>Audit method overview</h1>
        <h4>Ballot-Polling Audit</h4>
        <p>
        Ballot-Polling audits are a type of risk-limiting vote tabulation audit. This type of audit selects
        individual ballots at random and counts them by hand until there is strong evidence the outcome is
        correct or a full hand-recount is done. An advantage of ballot-polling audits is that they require
        relatively small number of samples compared to other vote auditing methods.
        Our ballot-polling audit implementation is based on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/evtwote12/workshop-program/presentation/Lindeman">
            "BRAVO: Ballot-polling Risk-limiting Audits to Verify Outcomes"</a> by Mark Lindeman, Philip Stark, and Vincent Yates.
        </p>
        <h4>Ballot-Comparison Audit</h4>
        <p>
        Ballot-comparison audits derive simple rules to select a sample size to audit in one round to perform a
        risk-limiting audit if ballot error is sufficiently low. In each round, a sample of drawn ballots are
        compared with the original Cast Vote Record (CVR), if a sufficient amount of ballots agree with the CVR,
        the audit can stop, else the audit may continue past the estimated sample size.  Our ballot-comparison
        audit implementation is based on
        <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/evtwote10/tech/full_papers/Stark.pdf">"Super-Simple Simultaneous Single-Ballot Risk-Limiting Audits"</a>
        by Philip Stark.
        </p>
        <h4>Canvass Audit</h4>
        <p>
        Canvass audits requires ballots to be distributed over batches and audits them within multiple stages.  This
        allows an auditor to set values for number of stages, risk limits and threshold. The number of stages is used
        to determine how many stages of auditing will be preformed before a full hand recount. The risk limit is used
        by CAST to guarantee that the chance of requiring a full hand recount is 1- (risk limit). Threshold is the
        tolerance for the percentage of incorrectly counted ballots within a batch. The audit will run per stage
        taking in the hand counted votes for randomly chosen batches. If the hand counted votes differ from the reported
        votes by more than the threshold, the audit will proceed to the next stage, or else the audit will be complete.
        Our canvass audit implementation is based on "<a href="doi.org/10.1109/tifs.2009.2034210">CAST: Canvass Audits by Sampling and Testing</a>"
        by Philip Stark.
        </p>
        <h4>Bayesian Ballot-Polling</h4>
        <p>
        Bayesian audits take in a sample tally of votes (hand-counted from paper ballots) and then run simulations
        of the election seeded with the sample tallies.  The candidates are then each given a probability to win an
        election using all of the simulation data.
        This is a ballot-polling audit, so it doesn't require a CVR or batches. As compared to the other BPA method,
        Bayesian ballot-polling "front-loads" the work, in that the user inputs hand-counted tallies before the audit
        begins. If, based on the sample tallies entered, the projected winners match the reported winners (according
        to reported vote totals) and have probability of at least 1 - (risk limit), the election results
        are confirmed.

        Our Bayesian ballot-polling implementation uses <a href="https://github.com/ron-rivest/2018-bptool">Ron Rivest's bptool</a>.
